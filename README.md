### Abstract

Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are most visited  domains on the Internet. They contain huge data about the users and the  relationships among them. To analyze and mine useful information from these  huge social network data, special graph-based mining tools are required that can  easily model the structure of the social networks.  Several such analysis tools are available with their own features and benefits.  Choosing an appropriate tool such as a programming language and its functions  and libraries, we can use it to do social network analysis on Facebook pages. We will use the R programming language for conducting the analysis on  Facebook football related pages dataset and as our project deals with data  analysis and statistics, R provides flexibility to use available libraries and hence  suites our work.
